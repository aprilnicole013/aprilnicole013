- 👋 Hello there, I'm April.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and product management.
- 🌱 I have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4 with goals to learn Fullstack Javascript.
- 💞️ As I grow as a developer, I’m hoping to collaborate on websites and applications to improve real world problems.

Enjoying the journey as I go 🐾
